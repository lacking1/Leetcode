#Leetcode

This is my first project, I just want to know the process of finish a project on github.


Now I review my leetcode history, and take notes on my understand about every problem.

One folder includes two files including xxx.cpp and xxx.txt. The former is the code answer, and the latter is interpretation about the problem.

I hope that I can do it for a long time.
